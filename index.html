            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>
              My name is Gudrun (pronounced good-rune, they/her) and I am an
              integrative counsellor and psychotherapist. Working integratively
              means that I aim to adapt the way I work to the person in the
              room, drawing from psychodynamic, existentialist and person
              centred theory among others.
            </p>
            <p>
              My practice embraces diversity of gender, relationship style and
              sexuality, and is sensitive to disability, intersectionality and
              cultural diversity. People need different things in order to feel
              safe and understood and I aim to meet clients where they are at
              and work at a pace appropriate to the individual.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the past seven years I have worked with a broad spectrum of
              people including those struggling with addictions, neurodivergent
              clients, students at the university of Sheffield and people from
              low socioeconomic backgrounds accessing counselling for the first
              time. I have experience working with clients who were facing
              bereavement, issues of identity and sexuality, as well as those
              who weren't exactly certain what it was they were bringing to
              therapy specifically but could tell that they were unhappy and
              felt that they might benefit from support.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am a registered member of the British Association of Counsellors
              and Psychotherapists (BACP) and abide by their standards and
              ethical guidelines.

                I believe that in order to understand ourselves we in turn need
                to feel seen and understood, and that a safe and confidential
                space is necessary to be able to face whatever brings us to
                counselling.
              </p>
              <p>
              My understanding of the role of counselling is to encourage a
              sense of agency in life, an increased freedom of choice rather
                than being confined to established patterns.
              </p>
              <p>
              As well as seeing clients in private practice I also currently
              work at Sheffield Mind. Prior to completing my counselling
              qualification I worked for Shelter England, the NHS and in the
                charity sector.
              </p>
              <p>
              I am able to offer counselling and psychotherapy in both English
              and German.

        <h2>Questions About Counselling</h2>
        <span class="subtitle">
          Regardless of whether you have previously accessed counselling, there
          may be a number of questions you have. If your questions aren't
          answered below or you would like to discuss further, please be sure to
          get in touch with me.
        </span>
        <div>
          <h4>What kind of therapy do you offer?</h4>
          <p>
            My way of working is called “Integrative Counselling and
            Psychotherapy”, meaning that rather than drawing exclusively from
            one way of working with people, I integrate different ideas and
            theories into my practice in order to best meet the circumstances
            and context of the person in the room with me. However, I am no art
            or drama therapist, so we will primarily be talking
          </p>
          <p>
            It is important to me to practice in an anti-racist, LGBTQ+
            inclusive, gender affirming and disability conscious way.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Online or in person?</h4>
          <p>
            I have extensive experience in working both face to face or via Zoom
            or GoogleMeets and am happy to try to accommodate your needs in this
            regard.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>What happens in the first session?</h4>
          <p>
            The purpose of a first session is generally to get an impression of
            what working together might be like and come to a decision of
            whether we want to move forward.
          </p>
          <p>
            To start off, we would have a look at what brought you to therapy
            and what it is you want to achieve in order to be able to work out
            what length of therapy and style of working might suit you. It's
            been proven that the main determining factor in efficacy of therapy
            is the therapeutic relationship. To aid this, I aim to work
            transparently, explaining the process to you as we go and regularly
            checking in so as to adjust as and when required.
          </p>
          <p>
            Together, we will go through the counselling agreement to ensure
            that there is mutual understanding of the more structural aspects of
            counselling like confidentiality, record keeping, costs, and
            cancellations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Towards the end of the session there will be time to decide how we
            want to proceed – whether that is personal therapy, or signposting
            and referral appropriate to your needs and situation.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Number and frequency of sessions</h4>
          <p>
            Sessions are generally weekly as counselling is a continuous process
            that benefits from regularity and continuity, but different
            intervals can be negotiated. The number of sessions is flexible and
            can be discussed in the first session – I have experience working in
            both short and long term formats, and there will be opportunity to
            review what works best for you and your circumstances.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Costs and length of sessions</h4>
          <p>
            The cost for a first session is £30, and after that it's £50 per
            session. Session duration is 50 minutes.

			Improved design idea: Have the collapse icon be attached to the bottom of the screen whilst you scroll down the gallery, so you don't have to go all the way to the bottom to close it. This also means that the button can be in a bordered container of some kind which means it will look better on the bottom too
