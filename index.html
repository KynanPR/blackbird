            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>
              Based on Bank Street in Sheffield City Centre, I provide
              inclusive, accessible and supportive counselling and psychotherapy
              both face to face and online.
            </p>

            <div>
              <p>
                My name is Gudrun (pronounced good-rune, they/her) and I am an
                integrative counsellor and psychotherapist. Working
                integratively means that I aim to adapt the way I work to the
                person in the room, drawing from psychodynamic, existentialist
                and person centred theory among others.
              </p>
              <p>
                My practice embraces diversity of gender, relationship style and
                sexuality, and is sensitive to disability, intersectionality and
                cultural diversity. People need different things in order to
                feel safe and understood and I aim to meet each client where
                they are at, and to work at a pace appropriate to the
                individual.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over the past seven years I have worked with a broad spectrum of
                people including those struggling with addictions,
                neurodivergent clients, students at the university of Sheffield
                and people from low socioeconomic backgrounds accessing
                counselling for the first time. I have experience working with
                clients who were facing bereavement and issues of identity and
                sexuality. I've also worked with clients who weren't certain
                what it was they were bringing to therapy specifically but could
                tell that they were unhappy and felt that they might benefit
                from support.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am a registered member of the British Association of
                Counsellors and Psychotherapists (BACP) and abide by their
                standards and ethical guidelines.

                  My own experience as a client at different stages of my life
                  has shown me that in order to understand ourselves we in turn
                  need to feel seen and understood. I find that a safe and
                  confidential space is necessary to be able to face whatever
                  brings us to counselling, and I feel honoured to share in the
                  often messy, chaotic and non-linear processes that unfold in
                  the therapy room.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My understanding of the role of counselling is to encourage a
                  sense of agency in life, an increased freedom of choice rather
                  than being confined to established patterns.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As well as seeing clients in private practice I also currently
                  work at Sheffield Mind. Prior to completing my counselling
                  qualification I worked for Shelter England, the NHS and in the
                  charity sector.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I am able to offer counselling and psychotherapy in both
                  English and German.

          <h2>Questions About Counselling</h2>
          <span class="subtitle">
            Regardless of whether you have previously accessed counselling,
            there may be a number of questions you have. If your questions
            aren't answered below or you would like to discuss further, please
            be sure to get in touch with me.
          </span>
          <div>
            <h4>What kind of therapy do you offer?</h4>
            <p>
              My way of working is called “Integrative Counselling and
              Psychotherapy”, meaning that rather than drawing exclusively from
              one way of working with people, I integrate different ideas and
              theories into my practice in order to best meet the circumstances
              and context of the person in the room with me. However, I am no
              art or drama therapist, so we will primarily be talking
            </p>
            <p>
              It is important to me to practice in an anti-racist, LGBTQ+
              inclusive, gender affirming and disability conscious way.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Online or in person?</h4>
            <p>
              I have extensive experience in working both face to face or using
              various online platforms and am happy to try to accommodate your
              needs in this regard.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>What happens in the first session?</h4>
            <p>
              The purpose of a first session is generally to get an impression
              of what working together might be like and come to a decision of
              whether we want to move forward.
            </p>
            <p>
              To start off, we would have a look at what brought you to therapy
              and what it is you want to achieve in order to be able to work out
              what length of therapy and style of working might suit you. It's
              been proven that the main determining factor in efficacy of
              therapy is the therapeutic relationship. To aid this, I aim to
              work transparently, explaining the process to you as we go and
              regularly checking in so as to adjust as and when required.
            </p>
            <p>
              Together, we will go through the counselling agreement to ensure
              that there is mutual understanding of the more structural aspects
              of counselling like confidentiality, record keeping, costs, and
              cancellations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Towards the end of the session there will be time to decide how we
              want to proceed – whether that is personal therapy, or signposting
              and referral appropriate to your needs and situation.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Number and frequency of sessions</h4>
            <p>
              Sessions are generally weekly as counselling is a continuous
              process that benefits from regularity and continuity, but
              different intervals can be negotiated. The number of sessions is
              flexible and can be discussed in the first session – I have
              experience working in both short and long term formats, and there
              will be opportunity to review what works best for you and your
              circumstances.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Costs and length of sessions</h4>
            <p>
              The cost for a first session is £30, and after that £50 per 50
              minute session.

			Improved design idea: Have the collapse icon be attached to the bottom of the screen whilst you scroll down the gallery, so you don't have to go all the way to the bottom to close it. This also means that the button can be in a bordered container of some kind which means it will look better on the bottom too
