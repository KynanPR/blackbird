				<h3>About me</h3>
				<div id="text-img">
					<img src="./assets/img/Gudrun.jfif" id="gudrun" alt="Photo of Gudrun" />
					<p>
						My name is Gudrun (pronounced good-rune, they/her) and I am an integrative
						counsellor and psychotherapist, currently working for Sheffield Mind and in
						private practice at Bank Street.<br />
						<br />
						Over the past seven years I have worked with a broad spectrum of people
						including those struggling with addictions, neurodivergent clients, students at
						the university of Sheffield and people from low socioeconomic backgrounds
						accessing counselling for the first time. I have experience working with
						clients who were facing bereavement, childhood and sexual trauma, issues of
						identity and sexuality, as well as those who weren't exactly certain what it
						was they were bringing to therapy specifically but could tell that they were
						unhappy and felt that they might benefit from support.<br />
						<br />
						I aim to adapt the way I work to the person in the room, drawing from
						psychodynamic, existentialist and person centred theory among others.<br />
						<br />
						I am a registered member of the British Association of Counsellors and
						Psychotherapists (BACP) and abide by their standards and ethical guidelines.
						Prior to completing my counselling qualification I worked for Shelter England,
						the NHS and in the charity sector.<br />
						<br />
						I am able to offer counselling and psychotherapy in both English and German.

				<h3>Questions about counselling</h3>
				<span class="subtitle">
					Regardless of whether you have previously accessed counselling, there may be a
					number of questions you have. If your questions aren’t answered below or you would
					like to discuss further, please be sure to get in touch with me.
				</span>
				<p>
					<b>What kind of therapy do you offer?</b><br />
					<br />
					My way of working is called “Integrative Counselling and Psychotherapy”, meaning
					that rather than drawing exclusively from one way of working with people, I
					integrate different ideas and theories into my practice in order to best meet the
					circumstances and context of the person in the room with me. However, I am no art
					or drama therapist, so we will primarily be talking.<br />
					<br />
					It is important to me to practice in an anti-racist, LGBTQ+ inclusive, gender
					affirming and disability conscious way.<br />
					<br />

					<b>Online or in person?</b><br />
					<br />
					I have extensive experience in working both face to face or via Zoom or
					GoogleMeets and am happy to try to accommodate your needs in this regard.<br />
					<br />

					<b>What happens in the first session?</b><br />
					<br />
					The purpose of a first session is generally to get an impression of what working
					together might be like and come to a decision of whether we want to move
					forward.<br />
					<br />
					To start off, we would have a look at what brought you to therapy and what it is
					you want to achieve in order to be able to work out what length of therapy and
					style of working might suit you. It's been proven that the main determining factor
					in efficacy of therapy is the therapeutic relationship. To aid this, I aim to work
					transparently, explaining the process to you as we go and regularly checking in so
					as to adjust as and when required.<br />
					<br />
					Together, we will go through the counselling agreement to ensure that there is
					mutual understanding of the more structural aspects of counselling like
					confidentiality, record keeping, costs, and cancellations.<br />
					<br />
					Towards the end of the session there will be time to decide how we want to proceed
					- whether that is personal therapy, or signposting and referral appropriate to
					your needs and situation.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Number and frequency of sessions</h3>
				<p>
					Sessions are generally weekly as counselling is a continuous process that benefits
					from regularity and continuity, but different intervals can be negotiated. The
					number of sessions is flexible and can be discussed in the first session – I have
					experience working in both short and long term formats, and there will be
					opportunity to review what works best for you and your circumstances.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Costs and length of sessions</h3>
				<p>
					The cost for a first session is £25, and after that it’s £50 per session.<br />
					<br />
					Session duration is 50 minutes.
